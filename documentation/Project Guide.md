# Project Guide

# PROJECT OVERVIEW
Incepta is a comprehensive technology transfer and grant matching platform that bridges the gap between academic innovations and commercial opportunities. The platform centralizes discovery, licensing, and funding workflows through automated data collection from 375+ technology transfer offices (TTOs) and AI-powered matching algorithms. Key features include:

- Automated technology listing aggregation from TTOs
- AI-powered matching engine for technologies and entrepreneurs
- Secure document management and messaging system
- LLM-powered grant writing assistance
- Analytics and reporting engine
- Role-based access control with multiple user types
